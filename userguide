        	2. Slave port: The port on the machine that should be used by the slave.
        	3. Mongod port range: the ports to be used by spawned instances of mongod
        	4. Persistent storage: Choose this option if the machine has and the slave is meant to use persistent storage
	States:
		1. Active (green)
                        Slaves can be set to active.
                        A slave working as planned. Active slaves will be monitored. If a problem occurs in an active slave, it will be set to problematic.
                2. Maintenance(blue)
                        Slaves can be set to maintenance mode.
                        A slave in maintenance mode will not be monitored and no new mongod instances will be spawned. Existing mongods will be left untouched.
                3. Disabled (grey)
                       Slaves can be set to disabled state.
